These are the works of my students studying C#.
These brilliant and talented learners only began working on this project when they only
began to code 1.5 month before. The results are tremendous.

Take a look at their brief to learn more about what they were assigned to do.
In short, they created a rougelike game straight from the console. Amazing!
